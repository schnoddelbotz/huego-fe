<h1>Hue not linked yet!</h1>
On huego-fe startup, no configuration file was provided/found ... so we need to first login huego-fe to your Hue now.

<p><em>Please press the Link button on top of your Hue bridge now!</em></p>

This page will auto-reload. Once the Hue was discovered and login was successful, we'll warp into huego-fe.
